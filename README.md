This is my Rust Notes!

What is RUST?
Rust is a modern, statically-typed programming language that focuses on providing a safe and efficient system-level programming environment. It was created by Mozilla and first released in 2010. Rust has gained popularity for several reasons:

1. Memory Safety: Rust has a strong focus on memory safety. It eliminates common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows through its ownership, borrowing, and lifetime system. This helps developers write more secure code.

2. Concurrency: Rust has built-in support for concurrent programming. It uses the concept of ownership and lifetimes to ensure thread safety, making it easier to write multi-threaded applications.

3. Performance: Rust is designed to provide performance similar to C and C++ while maintaining memory safety. It allows fine-grained control over system resources, making it suitable for systems programming.

4. Zero-cost Abstractions: Rust offers high-level abstractions without compromising performance. This means that developers can write expressive, high-level code without worrying about runtime overhead.

5. Ecosystem: Rust has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools. The package manager, Cargo, simplifies dependency management, building, and testing of Rust projects.

6. Cross-Platform: Rust is a cross-platform language, allowing developers to write code that works on various operating systems.

7. Web Assembly (Wasm): Rust is gaining popularity for developing WebAssembly (Wasm) modules that can run in web browsers. It's used for performance-critical web applications and games.

8. Systems Programming: Rust is often used for systems programming tasks, including operating systems, device drivers, and embedded systems development.

9. Game Development: Rust's combination of performance and safety makes it a good choice for game development, both on the server-side and for writing game engines.

10. Network Services: Rust's performance and memory safety features make it suitable for building network services, web servers, and other network-related applications.

11. Blockchain: Rust is used in blockchain development, where performance, security, and reliability are crucial.

Rust's safety guarantees and low-level control over system resources have led to its adoption in various domains where both performance and security are essential. It's especially well-suited for applications where memory safety and concurrency are critical requirements.
